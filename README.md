## Problem Statement

This dashboard provides insights into the revenue earned by a chocolate company during the years 2023 and 2024. It enables the company to evaluate its overall revenue performance and identify key contributors, including teams and individual salespersons. The insights help the company understand revenue trends and optimize team performance, aiding in better decision-making for future sales strategies.

The first page of the report focuses on overall company revenue, while the second page delves into the performance of teams and individual salespersons, highlighting their contributions to the total revenue.
